# React Introduction - Gmail

Today's exercise: 

**Repo:** boolean-uk-react-gmail-intro

**Description**

In this exercise, we are going to practice breaking down apps into components.

This is a great opportunity to work with a partner, it could look something like this:

- Discuss your approach to the task for 15 minutes
- Work on the exercise separately
- Have a retrospective session at the end of the day and share your learnings

**Instructions**

- Download the files from => https://codesandbox.io/s/react-intro-starter-p4tn2?from-embed
- Break down `App.js` into components
- Break down `app.css` into stylesheets
- Import the relevant stylesheets for each component

**Tips**
- You might find that breaking down sections of code using components isn't possible at this time, that's ok. Take these observations into the next few days.

**Challenge**
- Add a component for writing emails below the `email-actions` buttons, take a look at the image that comes with this message.
